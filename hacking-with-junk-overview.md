# 2016 Hacking Course Ideas
    
## Course Names

- Coding the physical world.
- Computing with junk
- Tangible/digital bits

## Overview

This course will introduce students to the process of product
development afforded by the new generation of single-board computers
and prototyping boards that have become available. Students will
design a smart hardware device using Raspberry Pi computers,
Arduino microcontrollers, sensors, and servos as the computing core of
their designs. They will create prototypes of their devices in
maker-space style labs, where they will rapidly sketch in hardware
using upcycled cardboard and other scavenged materials. Their designs
will bring computing power to bear on everyday problems like fitness,
health, home-automation, and emphasise the power of the maker to
create new forms of artistic expression and entertainment.

*Maybe make more of the "junk" aspect?*

## Educational Outcomes

- Produce designs for physical computing devices including sensors,
  actuators, and internet connectivity.
- Produce software for microcontrollers and single-board Linux
  computers to control their device and connect to web-based services.
- Produce basic circuits to connect sensors and actuators to
  microcontrollers using breadboards or prototyping hardware.
- Produce physical prototypes of devices using upcycled materials.
- Iteratively evaluate and refine prototype devices through a
user-centred design process.


## ACM/IEEE Bodies of Knowledge

### Core

- Systems (integrating hardware, software, network connectivity)
- Software Engineering (requirements gathering, stakeholder
  engagement, continuous evaluation & delivery)

### Electives

- HCI/New Interactive Technologies
- HCI/Design-oriented HCI
- HCI/Mixed, Augmented & Virtual Reality
- PBD/Mobile Platforms
- PBD/Cloud  (maybe spin up an AWS EC2 instance to talk to)

## Hardware kits

Each student should have a kit available for experiments in labs and
product designs.

### Raspberry Pi

Pros         | Cons
-------------|-------------------
Cheap        | high power
Well-known   | no wifi
audio onboard| no ethernet on Model A
video onboard| tricky to deal with GPIO
USB onboard  |no bluetooth
lots of GPIO |
lots of accessories |
available in large quantitites |

Test budget for one student:

- Raspberry Pi A+ 256MB - 27.78
- PSU - 15.65
- Adafruit GPIO breakout 9.89
- WiFi module - 14.57
- Servo - 12.14

need some kind of multi-parts experimentation kit.

- Stepper/DC motor HAT - 22.50
