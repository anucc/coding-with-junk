## Course Names

- Coding the physical world.

## Spiel

This course will introduce students to the process of product
development afforded by the new generation of single-board computers
and prototyping boards that have become available. Students will
design smart hardware devices, using Raspberry Pi computers, Arduino
microcontrollers, sensors, and servos as the computing core of their
designs. They will create prototypes of their devices in maker-space
style labs, where they will rapidly sketch in hardware using upcycled
cardboard and other scavenged materials. Their designs will bring
computing power to bear on everyday problems like fitness, health,
home-automation, and emphasise the power of the maker to create new
forms of artistic expression and entertainment.

## Educational Outcomes

- Produce designs for physical computing devices including sensors,
  actuators, and internet connectivity.
- Produce software for microcontrollers and single-board Linux
  computers to control their device and connect to web-based services.
- Produce basic circuits to connect sensors and actuators to
  microcontrollers using breadboards or prototyping hardware.
- Produce physical prototypes of devices using upcycled materials.
- Evalutes prototype devices with respect to design criteria and
  real-world usage.
